        <h1>Beds, Carriers and Slings</h1>
        <p>Choosing the right bedding for a Biewer Yorkie is essential for their comfort, health, and quality of sleep. Since they are a small and delicate breed, a soft, supportive bed with plush padding helps protect their joints and provides warmth. Opting for a washable, hypoallergenic fabric is ideal, as Biewers can be prone to allergies and sensitive skin. A cozy, enclosed bed or a padded cushion in a quiet, draft-free area will make them feel safe and secure. Additionally, selecting the right size ensures they have enough space to stretch out comfortably without feeling lost in a too-large bed. Investing in quality bedding helps keep your Biewer Yorkie happy, well-rested, and healthy. üê∂üí§</p>
