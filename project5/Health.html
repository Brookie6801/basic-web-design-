      <h1>Health and Nutrition</h1>
      <h2 class="heading_style">Overview</h2>
     <p>The Biewer Yorkie, a small but energetic toy breed, requires a well-balanced diet to maintain optimal health. High-quality dog food, rich in protein, healthy fats, and essential vitamins, is crucial for supporting their fast metabolism and maintaining a shiny coat. Because they are prone to hypoglycemia, especially as puppies, feeding them small, frequent meals throughout the day helps regulate their blood sugar levels. Including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in their diet can also promote healthy skin and fur. Additionally, ensuring they receive adequate hydration is vital to support kidney function and overall well-being.</p>

      <p>In terms of general health, Biewer Yorkies can be prone to genetic conditions such as patellar luxation, dental issues, and liver shunts. Regular veterinary check-ups, along with proper dental care like brushing and dental treats, can help prevent common oral health problems. Due to their small size, they are also susceptible to injury, so a safe environment and gentle handling are essential. Moderate exercise, such as short walks and interactive play, helps keep them fit without putting too much strain on their delicate joints. With a proper diet, routine vet visits, and regular exercise, a Biewer Yorkie can enjoy a long, happy, and healthy life.</p>

Since Biewer Yorkies can be prone to hypoglycemia, monitoring their diet and blood sugar levels with a vet‚Äôs guidance is important.

    <p>Regular exercise is essential for Biewer Yorkies to maintain a healthy weight, strong muscles, and good mental well-being. Despite their small size, they are energetic and playful, requiring daily walks and interactive playtime to stay active. Without proper exercise, they may develop obesity, joint issues, or behavioral problems due to pent-up energy. Engaging them in activities like short walks, fetch, or puzzle toys keeps them physically fit and mentally stimulated. A well-exercised Biewer Yorkie is a happy, well-balanced, and affectionate companion. üêæ‚ú®</p>
